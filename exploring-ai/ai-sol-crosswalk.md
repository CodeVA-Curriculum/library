## About the AI + CS SOL Crosswalk

This document outlines connections between AI/machine learning topics and the Virginia Computer Science Standards of Learning. @e have aligned a curated set of relevant SOLs to the [“Five Big Ideas in AI” framework by the AI4K12 organization](https://ai4k12.org/wp-content/uploads/AI4K12_Five_Big_Ideas_Poster_v2.pdf) and the [Kapor Center’s “Responsible AI & Tech Justice Guide”](https://kaporfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Responsible-AI-Guide-Kapor-Foundation.pdf). This resource is designed to help teachers understand which computer science Standards of Learning are related to AI and machine learning, and to provide some details about how those concepts fit into the important AI skills and knowledge students should develop during elementary and secondary school.
