## Overview

In this lesson, students explore the basics of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), focusing on the biases that can arise in AI models and the ethical considerations involved in their development and use. Through hands-on activities using Teachable Machine, students will create their own AI models, analyze the biases present, and discuss strategies to mitigate these biases. The lesson emphasizes the importance of fairness and justice in AI systems and encourages students to reflect on the societal impact of biased AI. 

This lesson was created by Amber Rauls-Drayer and Holly Sawyer and edited by Michelle Pealo and Jon Stapleton for CodeVA with support from the Kapor Center.
