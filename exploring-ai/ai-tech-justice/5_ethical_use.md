## Overview

In this lesson, students will explore ethical use in the programming, training, and application of artificial intelligence algorithms. They will reflect on experiences from previous lessons with machine learning technology and advocate for awareness and actionable ways to minimize, mitigate, and eliminate potential harms and injustices caused by AI technologies. They will create a video public service announcement as a performance based assessment.

This lesson was created by Holly Sawyer and edited by Michelle Pealo for CodeVA with support from the Kapor Center.
