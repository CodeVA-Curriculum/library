## Overview

In this lesson, students will investigate how AI models learn from datasets that include a variety of musical features such as harmony, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, phrasing, and melody. They will use Teachable Machine to train a model using their own sound data, analyze how subjective input can introduce bias, and reflect on the ethical implications of using AI in creative fields like music.

This lesson was created by Amber Rauls-Drayer and edited by Michelle Pealo for CodeVA with support from the Kapor Center.
