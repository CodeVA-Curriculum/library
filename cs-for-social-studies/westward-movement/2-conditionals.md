## Summary

In this lesson, students will learn about compound conditionals by playing the “Boole Says” game. Then, students will apply their knowledge as they predict, run, and investigate compound conditional structures written in Twine. Students start by examining a given code snippet, making predictions about what the program will do. Afterward students will run the program to check their prediction. In pairs or groups, students will collaborate to trace and label compound conditionals and variables in a provided Twine example.
