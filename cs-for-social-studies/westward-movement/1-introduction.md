## Summary

In this lesson, students engage in a historical jigsaw activity focused on westward expansion. Each student is assigned a different group of people to focus on (Native American, farmers, formerly enslaved persons, or Chinese immigrants). Students analyze primary and secondary documents to become experts on the experiences and/or challenges of their assigned group during westward expansion, and then share their insights with their peers. The lesson ends with a coding project where students create “postcards” by coding with Twine, expressing the perspectives of different groups experiencing the effects of westward expansion.
