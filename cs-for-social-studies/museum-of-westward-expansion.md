## Summary

Students use a large amount of primary sources when learning history.  Images are important for not only giving students a visual idea of a historical artifact or item, but they are also valuable when determining the reliability of the primary and secondary sources used.  In this lesson, students will create a ‘Museum of Westward Expansion Inventions’ using the platform twinery.org. This tour will include multiple types of links that will be written in code two different ways and citations to photos to prove the veracity of the images students provide. In the end, students will have their own little piece of history with artifacts (images) that are properly cited and linked.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Properly cite sources used in research 
- Analyze information that has been gathered and organized
- Investigate and understand the effect of technology on society in history
- Create a museum tour using basic coding in the [Twine](https://twinery.org) program
