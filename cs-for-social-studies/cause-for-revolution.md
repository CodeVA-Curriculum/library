## Summary

Students will apply their knowledge of the causes of the American Revolution to create an interactive story via Twine. The interactive story will be based on the pre-revolutionary war period from the point of view of a loyalist or a patriot. As a warm-up students will look at an optical illusion picture and as a class discuss point of view and perspective. Students will work in heterogeneous pairs/groups to research, outline, and create a pre-revolutionary story about a patriot or loyalist.
