## Summary

Women code-breakers changed the course of WWII by cracking Japanese codes that revealed the movements of people and supplies in the Pacific Islands. In this lesson, students will learn how specific information discovered led to a turning point when cryptographers were able to pinpoint the plans of the Pearl Harbor Attack’s “architect”, Admiral Yamomoto.

Students will examine videos and articles to find out more about this episode in history. In pairs or small groups, they’ll look at the US Post Office’s newly revealed stamp commemorating it. They’ll identify what they think are the pros and cons of the stamp and then design their own.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Learn about the “Code Girls” of WWII
- Consider the importance of code-breaking as part of military strategy
- Learn about the Japanese “Purple” code and how it was cracked
- Identify on maps: Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Pacific Islands
