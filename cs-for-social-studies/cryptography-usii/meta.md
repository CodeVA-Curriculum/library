## Overview

These lessons support our NSF Grant of Computer Science for Social Studies, This set of lessons uses standards from US History II to identify how Americaâ€™s armed forces became much stronger in World War I and WWII at code decryption and cipher creation, thanks in part to the help of groups who previously were never employed by the military, such as women and Native Americans.
