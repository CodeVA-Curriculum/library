## Summary

In small groups, students will be assigned two of the first ten amendments and pose the questions, “Which of these two amendments do you think is more important?” and “Why do you believe this?” in a survey of ten classmates. Then they will collect and organize the data electronically to create two visual representations of their information. Students will add their raw data and visualizations to a shared slideshow to present their findings to the class and explain why they chose this particular visualization model and what conclusions they can draw from their survey responses.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Collect, record, and organize data and create visualizations in Google Sheets (or Excel)
- Use evidence to draw conclusions about the first 10 amendments
- Evaluate the individual rights established by the Bill of Rights
