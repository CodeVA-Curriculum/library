## Summary

Students will work with a partner to pair-program a comparison of two different leaders and their role in the Civil War (Abraham Lincoln/Jefferson Davis, Ulysses S. Grant/Robert E. Lee, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson/Frederick Douglass) using Twinery.org. Their product must also incorporate and attribute existing digital media (i.e.images). Students will then find a partner group that selected different figures and peer review their Twine product with emphasis on usability, content, language, user perspective, image layout/attribution and ease of use. The feedback given must be addressed and incorporated. Students will then complete a Partner Evaluation form to review their experience working with pair programming.

This lesson can be divided into two class periods if necessary.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Describe the roles of Civil War leaders before and during the war.
- Describe how opposing views led to conflict
- Work with peers to review and adjust programs.
