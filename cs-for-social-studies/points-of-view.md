## Summary

This activity will ask students to trace various historical events, as well as state and national laws and their impacts on two different women in the South. Following along with a series of overlapping Twine stories, students will learn how computer programs can be constructed using simple variables and if-then statements to tell complex stories. Moreover, they will analyze how different women experienced historical events differently, leading to widely different points of view about the Civil War. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Trace computer program code, following if-then statements to predict outcomes.
- Construct an “if-then” statement using simple variables.
- Analyze and explain the ways in which historical events impacted affluent, slave-owning white women and black, enslaved women differently.
