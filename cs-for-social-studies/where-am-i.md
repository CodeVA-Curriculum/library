## Summary

Students will apply their knowledge of the characteristics of the five major regions to create "if" statements. As a warm-up students will complete a table using "if" statements.

During student-facing project, students will:

- Create 2-3 additional variables within the conditions chart that will direct the flow to determine the correct region.
- Record responses provided by their partner on an excel spreadsheet.
- Students will use responses provided to draw a conclusion of which region their partner is “located”.
