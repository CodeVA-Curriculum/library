## Overview

Computer Science Standard Alignment Guides are resources for teachers working to integrate computer science into their core curriculum. These guides explain the standards, give a sample activity or lesson that teaches the standard, and provide ways to incorporate CS learning experiences into other subject areas.

This particular guide is aligned to standard 3.IC.1 from the Impacts of Computing strand of the 2024 3rd Grade Virginia Computer Science SOLs.
