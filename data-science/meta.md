This group contains three lesson sequences addressing the high school Data Science Standards of Learning through project-based learning: [Data Science Unplugged](/library/browse/data-science/unplugged), [Data Science with CODAP](/library/browse/data-science/codap), and [Data Science with Python](/library/browse/data-science/python). Teachers can select a sequence of lessons using their preferred tool, or mix and match lessons from the three sequences to meet their goals and their students' needs.
