## Summary

Patterns are hidden everywhere, and can help us read because we can predict what might happen quickly.  Students will orally tell a fictional story in a sequential manner. Students will draw illustrations to match their story, and include some type of patterning (numerical, AB, cumulative story, etc). These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Identify patterns that authors use in their book
* Tell a story that contains a pattern
* Illustrate my story so that the pictures match the story
