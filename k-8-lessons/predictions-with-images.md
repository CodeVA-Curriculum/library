## Summary

Students will use decomposition strategies to predict what will happen in a story based on the pictures through the use of the 5W and 1H question words. Students will identify the characters and setting of the story and make a prediction based on the information they gained from the images. These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Use the illustrations in a story to make predictions
* Use the illustration to answer the 5W and 1H questions about a text
* Read to determine if my prediction was accurate
