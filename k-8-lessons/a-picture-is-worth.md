## Summary

Students will identify the characters, setting, and sequential events of a story and draw a picture summary including the main points and eliminating extra details. Abstraction is the act of eliminating extra information, so students will try to include only the bare essentials to tell the story elements. The teacher will assist them in finding elements that are important to include and students will work in groups of 3 to tell the beginning, middle, and end in a pictorial representation. These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380
