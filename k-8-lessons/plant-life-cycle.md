## Summary

In this lesson, students analyze characteristics and stages of a plant life cycle. Using a set of cards identifying different plants and the stages of their life cycles, students use computational thinking skills to compare and contrast features of each plantâ€™s life cycle. Students will sort the life cycles according to different features identified, then create an algorithm to be able to categorize plants based on their life cycle attributes.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

* Identify key parts of a plant life cycle including seed, germination of the seed, growth of the stem and roots, growth of leaves, growth of flowers, fertilization (pollination) of the flowers, production of fruit/new seeds, and death.
* Compare and contrast multiple ways to sort plant life cycles
* Create a table of features to organize plant life cycles
* Design an algorithm to sort plant life cycles into categories based on multiple attributes
