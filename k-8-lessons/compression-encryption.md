## Summary

In this lesson, students will compress and encrypt digital images using systematic methods. They will start by reducing a 16x16 image to 8x8 pixels by hand, ensuring the new image is recognizable. Next, students will create their own encryption protocol to alter the binary data of the image, making it harder to interpret while ensuring the method can be reversed. Throughout, students will apply their methods by hand and document each step to maintain reproducibility.

## Objectives

*Students will be able to...*

* Compress an image so it uses less binary information. 
* Encrypt some image data to hide its content.
