## Summary

Students will sequence a story by connecting images from the beginning, middle, and end of the story on a grid board and write the algorithm to connect them in order. The arrows used to connect the beginning, middle, and end will construct an algorithm. Students will test their algorithm and debug if there are errors. These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Sequence events in a story
* Use arrows to create an algorithm
* Retell a story in order with a beginning, middle, and end
