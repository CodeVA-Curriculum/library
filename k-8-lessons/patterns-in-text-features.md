## Summary

Students will identify the patterns that varying text features present within non-fiction texts and analyze the text features to predict and categorize information. Students will create a chart with examples of each text feature and how it helps them understand the text and connect this to the process of identifying repeats and loops through pattern recognition to make their programs easier to read and follow. These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

*  Use nonfiction text features to understand the text
*  Recognize the patterns that nonfiction text features follow and use them to understand the text
*  Identify these text features in a variety of nonfiction texts and categorize them by feature
