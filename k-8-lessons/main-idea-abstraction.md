## Summary

Students will read a nonfiction passage and identify the main idea, and use the concept of abstraction to eliminate extraneous details. Students will find clues to determine the main idea, and create a chart of essential details and non-essential details. The class may use one text together that they have read, or each student can use a different nonfiction text. Students will then create a mini-project in Scratch to demonstrate the main idea and supporting details of a nonfiction text. These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

*  Identify the main idea
*  Identify supporting details
*  Eliminate details that do not support the main idea
