## Summary

Students will compare 3 modes of media messages. The teacher will give an auditory commercial of a nonfiction text as an example. Students will work collaboratively to write a commercial for another non-fiction text, then work independently or in pairs to create a Scratch project as the visual example. Students will write algorithms to summarize the story, represent parts of the text and debug as needed. These materials were created by CodeVA in partnership with George Mason University and were funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Award #1837380

## Objectives

* Summarize nonfiction text
* Write a summary with a partner
