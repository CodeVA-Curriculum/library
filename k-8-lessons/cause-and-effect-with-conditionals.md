## Summary

The students will identify cause and effect relationships.  They will then read a story and use a Scratch programming conditionals worksheet to identify the if-then/cause-effect relationships from the story.  Students will then apply their knowledge of conditionals to sketch their own program using Scratch blocks that includes at least one conditional.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Identify examples of cause and effect relationships in real life
* Identify conditionals in a story
* Apply conditionals to a Scratch program
