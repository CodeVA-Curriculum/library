## Summary

Students will identify living and nonliving things in a Virginia woodland ecosystem and create a sample food chain.  Students will create conditional statements about their food chain, then write an algorithm using pseudocode to identify the steps of the food chain on paper.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

* Describe living and nonliving components in an ecosystem
* Differentiate among producers, consumers and decomposers in an ecosystem
* Explain how a change in one part of a food chain might affect the rest of the food chain
* Describe the concept of a conditional control structure 
* Read & write an algorithm that includes conditional control structures using pseudocode
