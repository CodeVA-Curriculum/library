## Summary

In this two part lesson, students will be introduced to conditionals. They will be able to make connections between conditional statements in English (if you are 12, stand up) and in code (MakeCode blocks). Once students have an understanding of conditional statements, they will complete a two-part mini-project. In the mini-project, students will create a simple game using conditional statements, and then assess and analyze their peers’ games. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Translate English-based conditional statements into code in MakeCode
- Use conditional statements to create a game
- Interpret events within peer’s games as conditional statements
