## Summary

In this lesson, students will compare experimental, theoretical, and simulated results of random events using coins, physical bar graphs, and a Micro:Bit. At the end of the lesson, students will complete a practice worksheet collecting and analyzing data experimentally, theoretically, and in simulation. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Calculate theoretical probability of a coin flip
- Express probability through decimals, 
- Use probability calculations and proportional reasoning to make predictions of experimental outcomes
- Articulate the differences between theoretical and experimental probabilities
