## Summary

In this lesson, students combine knowledge of computer simulations and histograms. Students roll two dice in pairs and track the sums of the values. Then, they plot their findings in a histogram. They then use code to see how (or if) the results of the histogram would change when more than two dice are used. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Represent simple probability with decimals
- Describe the differences between theoretical and experimental probability 
- Use histograms to display and interpret probability data.
- Read, trace, and write programs that simulate probabilistic phenomena
