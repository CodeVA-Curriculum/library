## Summary

In this lesson, students expand on their knowledge of histograms and simulations by repeating the summing experiment from the previous lesson. This time, students will modify the code to automatically roll the dice an increasing number of times, and roll dice with different numbers of sides. Students will see the affordances of code and simulation by creating more complex experiments than in previous lessons.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Represent simple probability with decimals
- Describe the differences between theoretical and experimental probability 
- Use histograms to display and interpret probability data.
- Read, trace, and write programs that simulate probabilistic phenomena
