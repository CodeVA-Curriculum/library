## Summary

In this project, students will demonstrate their understanding of probability and of various coding skills to create a probability-based game whose difficulty changes with changes in probability. Students will use a project design menu to build their project. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Calculate, by hand, the probability of random events
- Create a Micro\:Bit simulation to test probability
- Use “if” statements in code
- Analyze the differences between theoretical and experimental probability
