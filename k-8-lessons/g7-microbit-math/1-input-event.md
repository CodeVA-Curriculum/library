## Summary

In this introductory lesson, students will learn about Micro\:Bit programming by running and modifying input/event blocks and display functions. They will learn how to use buttons and gestures as inputs to trigger events and control the display on the Micro\:Bit LED matrix. Through hands-on activities and coding examples on MakeCode, students will gain a foundational understanding of coding logic and basic Micro\:Bit functionalities.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Use input/event blocks to write programs for the Micro\:Bit
- Use buttons and gestures as inputs
- Use display functions to control the Micro\:Bit LED matrix.
