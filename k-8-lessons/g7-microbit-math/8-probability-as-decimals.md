## Summary

In this lesson, students will learn probability concepts, recognizing and describing them within the context of a Micro\:Bit simulation. By manipulating code, students will apply the concept of probability as decimals, gaining hands-on experience with the Micro\:Bit. Additionally, they will analyze and compare theoretical and experimental probabilities, fostering a beginning understanding of the interplay between mathematical principles and real-world simulations. 

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

- Recognize and describe basic probability concepts.
- Apply the concept of probability as decimals using a Micro\:Bit.
- Analyze and compare theoretical and experimental probability.
