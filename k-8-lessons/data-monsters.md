## Summary

Students will represent personal data and encode a design document visualization in the form of a monster glyph.  Different attributes of the monster will represent the personal data.  Students will then decode each otherâ€™s monsters to understand information about one other.  

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Follow an algorithm to create a design document visualization (data monster)
* Understand and represent personal data
* Interpret encoded data on a data monster using a glyph key
* Collect data and create a corresponding graph
* Answer questions about data on a graph and design document visualization (data monster)
