## Summary

This lesson introduces students to the data cycle and uses line plots (dot plots) and stem-and-leaf plots to represent data. Students formulate questions, collect data from peers, and then organize it into graphical representations. They analyze the data to identify trends, make predictions, and draw conclusions, emphasizing the importance of data interpretation.
