## Summary

The teacher will ask the students a variety of questions to make them think about different aspects of the data listed on the weather cards.  The teacher will have the whole class show what is on their cards all at once through body movements to make the data visible to the rest of the class.  As a group, the students will draw conclusions, create hypotheses, and make predictions about the weather by making correlations between different subsets of the data.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Make and communicate careful observations.
* Classify based on similar characteristics.
* Sequence natural events chronologically.
* Investigate and understand basic patterns and cycles of natural events, including day and night, simple phases of the moon, and weather conditions related to seasonal changes.
* Analyze data that has been gathered and organized.
* Develop hypotheses from simple questions based on given data.
