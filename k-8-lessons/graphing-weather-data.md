## Summary

Students work in groups to use four weather tools (thermometer, barometer, anemometer, rain gauge) to collect weather data.  Students then look up historical weather data for a specific location and record the data in a chart and create a line graph to represent the historical data over the last 10 years.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to . . .*

* Analyze and report data on temperature, precipitation, and wind speed
* Use weather instruments (thermometer, barometer, rain gauge, anemometer) and observations of sky conditions to collect, record, and graph weather data over time; analyze results and determine patterns that may be used to make weather predictions
* Collect data to create charts and graphs
* Recognize and analyze patterns and relationships within data sets
