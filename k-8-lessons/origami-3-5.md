## Summary

Students will engage in a discussion about the concepts of algorithms and loops. They will then apply the pair programming technique to collaboratively create an origami model. During the activity, students will closely examine the algorithm, represented by the origami instructions, and identify the 'loops' ( steps that are repeated in these instructions).

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

* Students will understand the concepts of algorithms and loops.
* Students will apply the pair programming technique to collaboratively create an origami model.
* Students will examine the origami instructions (algorithm) and identify the 'loops' (repeated steps).
