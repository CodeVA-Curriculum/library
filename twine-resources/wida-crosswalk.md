## Overview

This resource is a table of "Can-Do Descriptors" for English-language learners using Twine to write and tell stories through coding. It's based on the [WIDA Can-Descriptors for grades 6-8](https://wida.wisc.edu/resources/can-do-descriptors-key-uses-edition-grades-6-8). The crosswalk is designed to help teachers and curriculum writers design accommodations for Twine projects and assignments.
