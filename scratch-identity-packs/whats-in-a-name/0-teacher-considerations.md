## Summary

Recently, childrenâ€™s literature centering on identity has been subject to intense scrutiny, and even attack. Some may fear that children will be encouraged to identify or act in a specific way simply by reading books like Calvin, which is about a transgender child, but this is a myth. On the contrary, it provides students the following opportunities: 

- Allows representation for all kids
- Allows students to not feel alone who might be struggling with similar feelings or experiences 
- Supports students that are questioning their identity in any way
