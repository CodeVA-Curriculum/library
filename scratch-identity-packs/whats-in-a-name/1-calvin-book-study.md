## Summary

*Calvin* is a story about a transgender child and his process of coming out to his family, changing names and adjusting his gender presentation. In this lesson, you will conduct a read-aloud, followed by opportunities to draw, discuss concepts of the book, create book awards, practice breathwork and make comprehension bracelets. Students will demonstrate their reading comprehension by summarizing, inferencing and predicting throughout the activities. Additionally, students will develop social-emotional awareness by exploring identity concepts and stress management techniques.
