## Summary

After reading *Calvin* and *The Name Jar*, students will create a summative project to show their understanding of the CS and SEL skills they’ve developed over the past several learning experiences. They will create a non-violent superhero or magical creature that represents them, which they imagine helping in their community.  The superhero will get their own special name and qualities which will form their identity.  No superhero is complete without an amazing story to tell!  Students will create a short story in Scratch about their superhero and how they help others. 

Lesson 7 of 7 in the [What’s in a Name? Lesson Sequence](/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs/whats-in-a-name), as part of the [Scratch Identity Packs](/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs) project.
