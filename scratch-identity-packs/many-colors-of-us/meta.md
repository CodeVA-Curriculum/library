## Summary

This lesson sequence offers students and teachers a way to explore the science and cultural relevance of skin color through analyzing children’s and young adult literature and coding with Scratch. The sequence is structured around a class reading of the young adult novel *The Skin I’m In* by Sharon G. Flake. Through read-aloud activities and self-differentiated Scratch projects, students learn about the science of skin color, ways that humans and computers describe color, how stereotypes can lead to bias, and how writing can be used as a tool for self-expression.

*The Skin I’m In* is a chapter book which is often recommended for students in grades 4-8 and will probably take several days or weeks to read. The individual lessons have been designed to complement each other and the novel in the order presented, but may be reorganized or connected to alternative novels if preferred.
