## Summary

The lesson is designed to help fourth and fifth grade students understand the scientific relationship between melanin and skin color. It includes a vocabulary scavenger hunt, hands-on activities to demonstrate the impact of the sun on skin color, reading a story, creating a journal entry, and collaborating on a classroom mural. The goal is to promote a more accurate and unbiased understanding of skin color  by providing factual information about the role of melanin in protecting the skin from the sun. This approach aims to counter myths and stereotypes surrounding skin color and promote a more inclusive learning environment.
