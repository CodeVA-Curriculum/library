## Overview

*Exploring Identity with Scratch* is a collection of lesson sequences for upper elementary school that integrates computer science, social-emotional learning, and literature. In each lesson sequence, students explore an aspect of their identity by engaging with one or more texts and creating programs using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

> These lesson sequences were developed with support from the CSTA Equity Fellows and the Scratch Foundation.
