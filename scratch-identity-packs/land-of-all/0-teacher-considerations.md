## Summary

Recently, children’s literature centering on identity has been subject to intense scrutiny, and attacks from anti-LGBT political activists. Some may fear that children will be encouraged to identify or act in a specific way simply by reading books like Neither; this is a myth. On the contrary, exploring literature like Neither and other texts that address childrens’ sense of identity has many socio-emotional benefits:

- Provides representation for kids whose experiences are not normally acknowledged in children’s literature
- Helps students who might be struggling with similar feelings or experiences to not feel alone 
- Supports students who are exploring or questioning their identity in developing ways of discussing these experiences
