## Summary

In this lesson, students do a matching activity to introduce vocabulary relevant to *Neither* by Airlie Anderson and the themes throughout the story. Students will discuss these concepts while reading the book, followed by a comparison activity that contrasts the two “lands” in the story. Building on the *Land of All* activities, students will discuss and practice how to properly ask and use someone’s pronouns. Finally, students will create a cartoon in order to practice asking someone which pronouns they prefer.
