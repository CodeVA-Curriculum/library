## Overview

Students will investigate the characteristics of heroes through the book Go Show the World. Students will select one of the heroes identified in the book and research them further, creating a Twine passage that shares what the student learned about the Native figure. This lesson was created through a partnership between CodeVA and the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium (VTEC).
