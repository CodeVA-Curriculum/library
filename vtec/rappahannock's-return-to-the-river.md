## Overview

Students will study the Rappahannock Tribe’s Return to the River, the re-acquisition of 462 acres of their ancestral land of Pissacoak (now called Fones Cliffs). Students will be provided with articles and summaries of the history of Pissacoak, her cultural and ecological significance, how human interaction has positively and negatively impacted/altered ecosystem dynamics, and how advancements in technology have aided conservation efforts in Rappahannock territories. Students will then study the Rappahanock’s return to the river project,  a plan to revitalize their ways of life in regards to stewarding the land, nourishing the youth, and educating the public. This lesson was created through a partnership between CodeVA and the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium (VTEC).
