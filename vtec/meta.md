## Overview

These materials were created in a partnership with Virginia Tribal Education Consortium under the Career and Technical Education Project, a 5-year project which promotes STEM education focusing on Computer Science. This project prepares Native American students to meet academic and technical standards for high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand industry and occupations and is funded through the US Department of Education's Native American Career and Technical Education Program.
