## Summary

In this activity, students will use a model of a computer, taking the form of a sort of board game, to explore writing programs that include input, output, variables, and arithmetic. Students will read, write, and debug pseudocode as they work on solving simple programming problems using manipulatives.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Read, write, and debug pseudocode
- Write algorithms that include variables and arithmetic operations
- Trace code that uses input, output, and variables to evaluate whether or not it works as expected
