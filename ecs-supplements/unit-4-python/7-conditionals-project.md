## Summary

Students will create a program that uses randomization to generate different outcomes, based on multiple conditions. Students will choose a project to create from a list of three options, or generate their own option that meets the activity requirements.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Design, test, and revise Python programs that use:
    - Conditional control structures, including “if” statements and “while” loops
    - User input
    - Random numbers
    - Logical & relational expressions
    - Arithmetic expressions
- Evaluate the use conditional statements in computing systems, and provide examples of how conditional control structures might be improved to avoid unjust outcomes
