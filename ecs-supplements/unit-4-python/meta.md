## Overview

CodeVAâ€™s ECS+Python lesson materials are collections of lesson plans and resources designed to help Virginia teachers facilitate computer science instruction where students learn to read, trace, debug, and write Python programs.

We have designed the ECS+Python lesson materials to be a drop-in replacement for Units 4 & 5 of the Exploring Computer Science curriculum. The sections below provide pacing guides for the materials. The lessons in italics with the gray background are forthcoming; contact <jonstapleton@codevirginia.org> for additional information or to receive an advance copy of the lesson materials.
