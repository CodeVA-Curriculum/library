## Summary

In this lesson, students will explore the “Testing Random Numbers” program to learn how to generate random numbers and use if-statements to make comparisons. Then, they will create a “Roll the Dice Game” to learn how to work conditionals and random numbers. At the end, students will create a simple program applying their knowledge of randomization and conditional control structures.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Read, debug, and write Python programs that:
    - Generate random numbers
    - Use conditional statements to produce multiple output statements
- Consider the role of automation in society, including computing systems that automate tasks through conditional control structures & data entry/collection
