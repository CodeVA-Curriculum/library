## Summary

In this lesson, students will learn how to make interactive programs using input event blocks, the MakeCode development tool, and the Micro\:Bit microcontroller. Students will work collaboratively to explore different methods of providing input to the Micro\:Bit, and will create a “fidget cube” puzzle box prototype which will serve as a starting point for their “lockbox” puzzles (see [Conditionals with Micro\:Bit](/library/browse/ecs-supplements/unit-4-microbit/4-conditionals) for the “lockbox” project description).

> Note: The “Fidget Cube” Lockbox Puzzle Prototype project is adapted from the Algorithms lesson from Microsoft’s CS Intro curriculum (with permission). You can [view the CS Intro curriculum here](https://makecode.microbit.org/courses/csintro/algorithms).

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Identify sensors on the Micro\:Bit microcontroller used to trigger input events
- Read, debug, trace, and write code using the MakeCode platform for the Micro\:Bit using input event blocks to create interactive interfaces
