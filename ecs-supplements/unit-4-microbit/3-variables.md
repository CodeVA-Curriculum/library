## Summary

This lesson introduces the use of variables to store data or the results of mathematical operations. Students will practice giving variables unique and meaningful names. At the end of the lesson, students will practice using variables by creating a “scorekeeping” program, using the Micro\:Bit to keep track of the score for a game.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Create a variable, set the variable to an initial value, and change the value of the variable within a Micro\:Bit program.
- Explain that a variable holds one value at a time, and that when you update or change the value held by a variable, the new value replaces the previous value.
- Apply the above knowledge and skills to create a unique program that uses variables as an integral part of the program.
