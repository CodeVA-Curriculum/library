## Summary

In this lesson, students will learn how to write conditional control structures (e..g, “if” statements) to have a Micro\:Bit make automated decisions based on sensor input. At the end of the lesson, students will use these skills to build a “lockbox” puzzle for their peers to solve.

## Objectives

*The students will be able to...*

- Read, debug, trace, and write conditional control structures, relational expressions, and logical expressions
- Design an interactive puzzle interface that a user can “solve” in a minute or less
